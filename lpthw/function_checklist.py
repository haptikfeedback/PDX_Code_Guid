# This is a checklist to help with functions

"""
*Did you start your function definition with def?
*Does your function name have only characters and _ characters?
*Did you put an open parenthesis right after the function name?
*did you put your arguements after the parenthsis separated by commas?
*Did you make each argument unique (meaning no duplicated names)?
*Did you put a close parenthesis and a colon after the arguments?
*Did you indent all lines of code you want in the fucntion four spaces? No more, no less.
*Did you "end" your function by going back to writing with no indent (dedenting, we call it)?
"""

# When you run ("use" or "call") a function, check these things:
"""
*Did you call/use/run this function by typing its name?
*Did you put the ( character after the name to run it?
*Did you put the values you want into the parentheses separated by commas?
*Did you end the function call with a ) character?
